🩺 Silent Disease Early Detection Engine

1️⃣ Problem Statement

PS05 – Silent Disease Early Detection Engine

Many lifestyle-related diseases remain undiagnosed for years because early symptoms are subtle, ignored, or misunderstood. Health signals are scattered across daily habits, work patterns, and stress levels, while existing healthcare systems rely heavily on reactive, symptom-based diagnosis.

This lack of early awareness creates a major gap in preventive healthcare, often leading to late diagnosis and serious complications.

Detect what patients don’t even know they have.

📌 Project Overview

SilentSense AI is an AI-driven preventive health risk insight system designed to identify early health risks before visible symptoms appear. Instead of focusing on diagnosis, the system emphasizes risk awareness and prevention.
The platform analyzes lifestyle habits, work patterns, and stress indicators to generate probability-based health risk scores. It also integrates real-time location intelligence to recommend nearby clinics and hospitals, helping users take timely action.


✨ Key Highlights

Detects silent and lifestyle-related health risks

Uses AI-assisted probabilistic scoring, not yes/no outcomes

Provides explainable insights behind risk scores

Generates doctor-ready health summaries

Recommends nearby clinics and hospitals

Designed for non-clinical, everyday users




⚙️ How SilentSense AI Works

User enters lifestyle and work-related inputs

System aggregates subtle health-related signals

AI logic analyzes combined behavior patterns

Risk probability score is generated

Preventive insights and guidance are shown

A concise health risk summary is created

Nearby clinics and hospitals are recommended using location data

Connecting lifestyle data with AI to enable early preventive awareness.




🧠 What Makes SilentSense AI Innovative?


Shifts healthcare from reactive diagnosis to preventive awareness

Uses everyday behavior data, not clinical tests

Provides risk trends over time
