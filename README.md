Repository for remote coders - Vibe Coding Hackathon

**1. Problem Statement :-**
Build an AI-driven early risk detection system that:
.Aggregates non-obvious health signals, such as:
   . 1Lab trends over time
   . Lifestyle data (sleep, activity, nutrition)
   . Stress & mental health indicators
   . Family history patterns
. Detects silent or early stage diseases before clinical diagnosis
. Generates risk probability scores, not binary outcomes
. Provides preventive action recommendations for patients and doctors
